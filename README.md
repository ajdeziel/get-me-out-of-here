# Get Me Out Of Here!
## aka The VAST (Vehicular collision Avoidance for Safety of Travel) Project
Utilising publicly available data from the National Collision Database from Transport Canada under the Open Government Licence - Canada, this web application is designed to inform road users of problematic areas. By analysing the collision data collected, it is overlayed onto a Google Maps API to generate a heat map of areas with consistent issues, including:

* High and consistent amount of vehicular collision incidents
* Road surface conditions
* More functionality planned!
